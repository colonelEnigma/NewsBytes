Client-Server Architecture
==========================
A static web page sends a request to a service using simple JavaScript (possibly an API). The service returns the data and displays an HTML page to the client.
The HTML is rendered on the server, which provides a number of benefits such as SEO, linkability, and an instant first page load. Server Side Rendering is enabled even when JS is disabled in the browser.
